v0.1.10, 11/20/2013 -- Added support for XuLA2-LX9 board.
v0.1.9,  05/15/2013 -- Added ability to load Xilinx bitstream files directly into serial configuration flash.
                       Fixed byte order of addresses sent to the W25X serial flash.
                    
v0.1.8,  05/14/2013 -- Fixed FlashDev class so address bounds could not go outside the min/max addresses for the device.
                    
v0.1.7,  05/11/2013 -- Added FlashDevice class for reading/writing flash memory devices.
                       Made Pic18f14k50 class inherit from the FlashDevice class for flash read/write operations.
                       Added routines for reading/writing serial configuration flash on the XuLA and XuLA2 boards.
                       Extended xsload.py to enable serial flash uploading and downloading.
                    
v0.1.6,  04/30/2013 -- Fixed xsusbprg.py so it works under linux.
                       Fixed USB read/write timeouts so they are dependent upon the amount of data transferred.
                       Replaced exit() with sys.exit() in scripts.
                    
v0.1.5,  04/19/2013 -- Added XuLA firmware .hex files for use with xsusbprg.py.
                       Fixed xsusbprg.py so it would upgrade XuLA board firmware by default.
                       All user-accessible scripts now use xstools_defs.py to get a unified version #.
                       Added .rules file for USB connections to XESS boards.
                    
v0.1.4,  04/01/2013 -- Replaced bitarray module with pure-Python bitstring module.
                    
v0.1.3,  02/15/2013 -- Fixed so multiple XsUsb objects can share a single USB link to access an XESS board.
                    
v0.1.2,  02/14/2013 -- Changed CR-LF EOL in .py files to LF EOL so linux wouldn't barf.
                    
v0.1.1,  01/23/2013 -- Use pypubsub instead of wxpython for publish/subscribe communications.
                    
v0.1.0,  01/06/2013 -- Initial release.
